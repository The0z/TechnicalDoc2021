                <p>Time to build and program a motorcycle that can self-balance and maneuver by itself using a flywheel. The goal of this project is to
                teach physics, control algorithms, and how to simulate a vehicle's overall behavior. 
                </p>
                <p>The motorcycle project consists of a two-wheeled robot that can balance and move using a rotating disc, which we will call inertia wheel from now on, 
                to compensate if the motorcycle loses balance. The motorcycle is controlled by an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, the Arduino Nano Motor Carrier, a DC motor to move the back wheel, DC motor with Encoder to control the inertia wheel and a standard servo motor to steer the motorcycleâ€™s handle.
                </p>
                <p> This project will teach you the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="contentILList">How to program the motorcycle using Mathworks Simulink</li>
                    <li class="contentILList">Control its balance algorithm and make it move in a straight line</li>
                    <li class="contentILList">Improve the quality of the control algorithms through rapid prototyping</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Assembling the Bike</h3>
                <p>Before you begin coding and modelling the project you need to build it! A quick assembly video can be seen below. <br><b>BEWARE:</b> the motorcycle will take approximately 45 minutes to build.</p>

                <h1>Further Work</h1>
                <p>In this process we went through the entire design flow to implement a controller to solve the problems of balancing the motorcycle:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Deriving equations based on physical principles. We primarily relied on Newton's law when deriving equations.</li>
                  <li>Implementing equations in software to simulate the system behavior.</li>
                  <li>Developing a model using Simscape, a domain-specific library for modelling physical systems.</li>
                  <li>Designing a feedback controller and testing it in the loop with a Simscape model.</li>
                  <li>Implementing the feedback controller on real hardware.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some ways to further our work can be seen below:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>External Mode with Wi-Fi (See Below)</li>
                  <li>Balancing with Straight Motors (to be investigated later)</li>
                  <li>Balancing with Steering (to be investigated later)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>External Mode with Wi-Fi</h3>
                <p>So far we have been running our models in the external mode through a USB cable, which means we need to keep the motorcycle in close proximity to our laptops. 
                In order to let the motorcycle drive away from our computers, which need to rely on wireless communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi. 
                In order to configure a model to run in external mode via Wi-Fi, open Configuration Parameters and navigate to the Hardware Implementation pane. 
                Expand Target hardware resources by clicking on it and then click Wi-Fi properties. Enter your network credentials in Configuration Paramters of the motorcycle</p>
                <p>This will allow the Simulink model connecting to the specified Wi-Fi network.</p>
                <p>Next we would like to switch the external mode communication interface to Wi-Fi (Configuration parameters --> Hardware Implementation --> Communication interface --> WiFi)</p>
